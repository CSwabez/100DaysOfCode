# 100DaysOfCode
Attempting the 100DaysOfCode Challenge

## Day 1 - Basic HTML & CSS (05/01/2021)
I had already started an attempt on this challenge a few months ago after my exams ended, but immediately fell off. I belive the mistake I made last time was ignoring the 1-hour time limit and continuing for a few more hours after. I ended up continuining until I was bored and sick of doing it, this made it much harder to motivate myself to continue the next day. This time I'll try to stick to the time limit unless I'm doing something I'm actually really enjoying.
  - Completed the Basic HTML section of the FreeCodeCamp course and moved onto CSS.
  - I've also decided to do each section as it's own file in a project folder rather than doing everything on a single file, gives more flexibility.

## Day 2 - Continued CSS (06/01/2021)
I'm sticking to the 1 hour sessions for now, whilst I'm still in the early stages, but will eventually need to increase the daily time once I've taken to the habit of coding everyday as each of these full lessons are 300 hours and I can't spend almost a year on each.
 - Continued on the CSS section of the FreeCodeCamp course.

## Day 3 - Basic CSS Complete (07/01/2021)
I started later than usual today, mainly because I had other things I needed to do around the house first. Still managed to do the full hour though and went a bit over just to finish the CSS section, would've felt silly to leave it at 96%.
 - Completed the Basic CSS Section of the course, will now be moving on to Applied Visual Design.

## Day 4 - Applied Visual Design (08/01/2021)
Started a lot later than planned today, ended up finishing at almost midnight, since I spent alot of time helping with some other work. Almost decided to just leave it today but I'm glad I went ahead and got it done.
 - Started the Applied Visual Design section of the course.

## Day 5 - Colour Theory (09/01/2021)
Managed to start earlier today. Got distracted in the middle and only did a little bit before there was hardly any time left. Chose to reset the timer and try again. Got the full hour finished and feel better for it.
 - Continued the Applied Visual Design part of the course.
 - Learnt a bit about colour theory and selected some colours I might decide to use when designing my website,

## Day 6 - Animation (10/01/2021)
Got into the animations section.

## Day 7 - Accessibility (11/01/2021)
Progress is going steadily, I'm continuing to write my own notes and versions of the lessons I'm learning in atom alongside each challenge.
 - Completed the Applied Visual Design Section
 - Started the Applied Accessbility Section
