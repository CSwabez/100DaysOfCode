# 100DaysOfCode
Attempting the 100DaysOfCode Challenge

##Day 1 - Basic HTML & CSS
I had already started an attempt on this challenge a few months ago after my exams ended, but immediately fell off. I belive the mistake I made last time was ignoring the 1-hour time limit and continuing for a few more hours after. I ended up continuining until I was bored and sick of doing it, this made it much harder to motivate myself to continue the next day. This time I'll try to stick to the time limit unless I'm doing something I'm actually really enjoying.
  - Completed the Basic HTML section of the FreeCodeCamp course and moved onto CSS.
  - I've also decided to do each section as it's own file in a project folder rather than doing everything on a single file, gives more flexibility.
