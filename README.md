# 100DaysOfCode
Attempting the 100DaysOfCode Challenge

## Day 1 - Basic HTML & CSS (05/01/2021)
I had already started an attempt on this challenge a few months ago after my exams ended, but immediately fell off. I belive the mistake I made last time was ignoring the 1-hour time limit and continuing for a few more hours after. I ended up continuining until I was bored and sick of doing it, this made it much harder to motivate myself to continue the next day. This time I'll try to stick to the time limit unless I'm doing something I'm actually really enjoying.
  - Completed the Basic HTML section of the FreeCodeCamp course and moved onto CSS.
  - I've also decided to do each section as it's own file in a project folder rather than doing everything on a single file, gives more flexibility.

## Day 2 - Continued CSS (06/01/2021)
I'm sticking to the 1 hour sessions for now, whilst I'm still in the early stages, but will eventually need to increase the daily time once I've taken to the habit of coding everyday as each of these full lessons are 300 hours and I can't spend almost a year on each.
 - Continued on the CSS section of the FreeCodeCamp course.

## Day 3 - Basic CSS Complete (07/01/2021)
I started later than usual today, mainly because I had other things I needed to do around the house first. Still managed to do the full hour though and went a bit over just to finish the CSS section, would've felt silly to leave it at 96%.
 - Completed the Basic CSS Section of the course, will now be moving on to Applied Visual Design.

## Day 4 - Applied Visual Design (08/01/2021)
Started a lot later than planned today, ended up finishing at almost midnight, since I spent alot of time helping with some other work. Almost decided to just leave it today but I'm glad I went ahead and got it done.
 - Started the Applied Visual Design section of the course.

## Day 5 - Colour Theory (09/01/2021)
Managed to start earlier today. Got distracted in the middle and only did a little bit before there was hardly any time left. Chose to reset the timer and try again. Got the full hour finished and feel better for it.
 - Continued the Applied Visual Design part of the course.
 - Learnt a bit about colour theory and selected some colours I might decide to use when designing my website,

## Day 6 - Animation (10/01/2021)
Got into the animations section.

## Day 7 - Accessibility (11/01/2021)
Progress is going steadily, I'm continuing to write my own notes and versions of the lessons I'm learning in atom alongside each challenge.
 - Completed the Applied Visual Design Section
 - Started the Applied Accessbility Section

## Day 8 - Continued Accessibility (12/01/2021>
There probably won't be many updates on my feelings until I start the projects since it's just pretty steady and basic learning of the concepts at the moment.
 - Continued the Applied Accessibility Section up to dates.
 
## Day 9 - Accessibility Complete (13/01/2021)
 - Completed the Applied Accessibility Section, will move onto Responsive Web Design next.
 
## Day 10 - CSS Flexbox (14/01/2021)
The Responsive Web Design section was very short so I got through that much quicker than the other topics. I've moved on to CSS flexbox now. I feel that the FreeCodeCamp tutorials for Flexbox by themself aren't all that great for learning this new concept so I've opted to pair them with another medium. For this I'll be using Flexbox Zombies from Mastery Games.
 - Completed the Responsive Web Design Challenges section.

## Day 11 - Flexbox Zombies (15/01/2021)
I think I made the right choice using Flexbox Zombies, it taches you step-by-step and gives plenty of opportunities for practice. The next section on FreeCodeCamp is CSS Grid and Mastery Games also has a game for that, Grid Critters, so I will likely also use that for the next section.
 - Completed up to and including Chapter 4 of Flexbox Zombies.

## Day 12 - Flexbox Zombies (16/01/2021)
I've been starting too late recently so today I made an effort to ensure that this was the first thing I did after having breakfast, feels a lot more productive this way.
 - Completed Chapter 7 of Flexbox Zombies.

## Day 13 - Flexbox Zombies (17/01/2021)
I've completed up to and including chapter 11 of the game. Only one chapter left which I assume will be to combine everything I've learnt, so I'll leave this until tomorrow to see if it's stuck. I'll move onto Grid once this is done.
 - Completed Chapter 11 of Flexbox Zombies
 
## Day 14 - ~~CSS Grid~~ Flexbox Practice (18/01/2021)
I've now completed all of the challenges in Flexbox Zombies, it's a great resource and I've managed to remember all of the commands over multiple days, will see how long that lasts. As it turns out, it's CSS Grid counterpart, Grid Critters, is not free. Rather it is $99, a sum I cannot currently afford so instead I will have to use other resources. I will bookmark it and see if it reduces price in a sale.
 - Completed Flexbox Zombies
 - ~~Began the FreeCodeCamp CSS Grid Section and will complement it with Grid Garden.~~
 I decided instead of immediately starting Grid that it would be better for me to practice the Flexbox I learned on an actual website rather than just through the game. I started building a website based on music similar to the one from A Levels I did in Delphi/Pascal. I'm using Kurzgesagt and Spotify as references for the layout and theme of the website since I find their website aesthetically pleasing. I spent about ~~6~~ 10 hours on coding today.
  - Created most of the first page of my website using HTML/CSS and a tiny bit of JS. 

## Day 15 - HTML/CSS Practice (19/01/2021)
I've been continuing on the website I started yesterday. Today I moved to altering how the elements would appear on the page. I used Michal Snik's AOS (Animate-On-Scroll) library to make the cards fade in and out of the page depending on the scroll position. It works very well and does exactly what I needed it to, my page is finally looking how I initially imagined. Spent about 3 hours coding today.

## Day 16 - HTML/CSS Practice Continued (20/01/2021)
Finetuned the website a bit more and found some bugs that would stop the webpage from working properly in some rare instances, spent my time fixing these.

## Day 17 - CSS Grid (21/01/2021)
Decided that I had spent enough time on the Flexbox practice and felt it was time to move onto Grid. I have done around half of the tutorial challenges for Grid today whilst continuing to make notes and my own versions of the challenges in Atom as I go.

## Day 18 - CSS Grid (22/01/2021)
Completed the 2nd half of the Grid section today.

## Day 19 - Grid Practice (23/01/2021)
Before completing the projects section I wanted to challenge myself to re-create the webpage I made with Flexbox but with Grid. This took a few hours to do but I completed it and to a higher standard than my first attempt. Though I'm less familiar with Grid due to not having access to Grid Critters, I still find it simpler and more intuitive than Flexbox.
 - Recreated webpage in Grid

## Day 20 - HTML/CSS Projects (24/01/2021)
Started the projects section of the html/CSS certification.

## Day 21 - Survey Form Project (25/01/2021)
Decided to do the Survey Form since the tribute page is quite basic and boring to complete. It doesn't really add anything that the other projects won't have so I'd rather work on more difficult and interesting projects.
 - Completed the Survey form using HTML & CSS w/ both Flexbox and Grid

## Day 22 - Survey Form Project (26/01/2021)
Fixed some issues that would crop up when changing the aspect ratio.

## Day 23 - Product Landing Page (27/01/2021)
Started creating the Product Landing Page.

## Day 24 - Product Landing Page (28/01/2021)
Finished creating the Landing Page in the way I would like it to look. Tomorrow I will make a 2nd copy to change it to include everything the course wants.

## Day 25 - Product Landing Page (29/01/2021)
The course wanted me to include things like an embedded video and an email input field which I didn't want on my original site but needed in order to submit the webpage, I've added these to a copy aswell as a media query fixing the layout for smaller screens.

## Break
Unfortunately, I will be quite busy with something else over the next 3 days will need to take a break here before continuing on.

## Restart
Well, I stopped for a lot longer than I was planning to, really fell off. Clearly I can't just continue and act like I'm sitll going after ignoring this for two months, restarting fresh again now.

## Day 1 - JavaScript (22/03/21)
Completed some of the lessons on JavaScript, I'm ~50% of the way through the 1st section now.
