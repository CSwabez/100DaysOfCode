    <!--It's important to include alt text explaining what the image is whenever you use an image on a webpage both for when the image fails to load and for
      use by those with visual impairments. The Text-to-Speech software they use will read this alt text to inform them of what the image is displaying.-->

    <!--When an image or multiple images have already been explained within a title or some other text, alt text for the image may be redundant.
      In such a case, you should still add an alt attribute but you may leave it as an empty string.-->

      <!--Another important factor to consider is the heirarchical relationships between your headings. They should not be chosen solely based on size,
      but rather they should have semantic meaning. E.g. Just because you want your Conclusion heading to be smaller than your Intro heading does not mean
      that you should use h1 for Intro and h2 for Conclusion. They are separate sections holding equal semantic meaning, they should both be the same type.
      Just change the font size of your conclusion.-->
