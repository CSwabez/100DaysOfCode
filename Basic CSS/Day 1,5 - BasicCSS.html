<!--Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) tell the browser how to display the text and other content that you write in HTML.

Note that CSS is case-sensitive so be careful with your capitalization.

CSS has been adopted by all major browsers and allows you to control:

color
fonts
positioning
spacing
sizing
decorations
transitions
There are three main ways to apply CSS styling.
1) You can apply inline styles directly to HTML elements with the style attribute.
2) Alternatively, you can place CSS rules within style tags in an HTML document.
3) Finally, you can write CSS rules in an external style sheet, then reference that file in the HTML document.
Even though the first two options have their use cases, most developers prefer external style sheets because they keep the styles separate
from the HTML elements. This improves the readability and reusability of your code.-->
